### Features ðŸ’¡

* Online hotel reservation

### Report
In this practical work we have made a website using the latest 
technologies for Hotel reservation, where a client can simply 
choose a date, the suitable price of a room, and then can 
submit his request simply. We used J2EE which consists of a 
set of APIs, services, and protocols that provide the 
functionality to develop multi-tiered web-based applications. 
It includes several technologies that extend the functionality 
of the Java SE APIs, such as Servlets, Connectors, Enterprise 
JavaBeans, in the core of J2EE we can find EJBâ€™s which provide 
features such as declarative transactions and security via 
annotations.
